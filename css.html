    <h2><strong>CSS</strong></h2>
    <p>
    Dependent sheets or cascading stylesheets (CSS)are style sheet languages
    that describe how markup languagesare actuallydisplayed,and are often used
    in HTMLand XHTML,and can also be used in XML. It is standard in the default
    filename W3C,and has a high degree of freedom when defining layoutsand styles.
The default filename[2]is style.css

If the markup language(ex: HTML)is responsible for the body of the website,
CSS is responsible for decorating it like clothes and accessories.
In other words, you can leave the HTML structure intact and make changes
to the CSS file to make it look like a completely different website.

For CSS3,which is currently under development,we've added the ability to replace
images created by graphics editing programs,such as shadow effects,
gradients, and transformations. In addition, various animation
functions have been added to replace Adobe Flashto some extent.</p>
