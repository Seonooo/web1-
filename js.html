    <h2><strong>js</strong></h2>
    JavaScript is an object-based script programming language.
    This language is commonly used within a Web browser and has the ability
    to access built-in objects from other applications.
    It is also used for server programming, such as runtime environments
    such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by
    BrendanEich of Netscape Communications Corporation,
    first named Mocha and later liveScript, and eventually became JavaScript.
    There are similaritiesbetween Javaand syntax in Sun Microsystems,
    but this is actually because both languages are based on the basic
    syntax of the C language,and Java and JavaScript have a weak direct
    connection.
    Other than names and phrases,there are more similarities to self orscheme
    than Java.
    JavaScript is recognized as the language that best implements
    ecmascriptstandards and is supported by default in most browsers
    until ECMAScript 5 (ES5), but after ECMAScript 6 it is compiled into a
    transfilerfor browser compatibility.
