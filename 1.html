    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">Hyper Text MarkupLanguage (HTML, Culture: Ultra-Basic
    Expression Language, Hyper-Main Expression Language)</a></p>
    is the dominant markup languagefor web pages,
    and HTML also provides a way to create structured documentswith links,
    citations, and other items, as well as to indicate structural meanings for the
    body, such as titles, paragraphs, and lists. It can also be used to embed
    images and objects and create interactive forms. HTML is written in the form
    of an HTML element that is "tagged" surrounded by angle bracketsin the
    content of a web page. HTML can include or recall scriptssuch as JavaScript
    that affect the behavior of HTML processing devices, such as web browsers,
    and CSS that define the appearance and placement of the body and other items.
    W3C,co-director of HTML and CSS standards, recommends the use of CSS for clear
    and superficial markup.
